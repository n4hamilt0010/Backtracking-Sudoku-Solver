# Backtracking-Sudoku-Solver
Sudoku solver using a backtracking algorithm

This project visually demonstrates how my backtracking algorithm solves a sudoku puzzle.<br>
When running the executable you will have the options of "solve" which will display the algorithm at work, "reset" to reset the board and "new board" to see the algorithm at work 
on a new/random board.<br><br> 
Before starting the project I always knew that I wanted to be able to visually display the algorithm at work. Having no experience in front-end development, I wasn't too sure 
how to accomplish this goal. After having completed the algorithm in C, I did some research on how to visually display it, I then came across QT-creator, which I knew I'd be able
to work with since it was similar to C. Considering I had never developed anything front-end related and I also had no experience in C++ at the time, I dediced my best course of
action would be to find some source code online and change it so that it fit my needs.<br> 
The folder "backtracking algorithm" contains the algorithm that I developed in C and the folder "Visualizer" contains all the C++ files which I modified. (The original source 
for the "Visualizer" can be found at https://github.com/laxect/sudoku-Qt).
